                    <h3 id="initiating-the-session">Initiating The Session</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Build Session:</strong> An application window is available for a user to select a
                            set of tasks to
                            perform. The session will load the selected configuration, build the session archive and
                            load the performing module that will perform a specific task
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Verify Session Data:</strong> A session could have a single set of parameters or a
                            matrix of hundreds of permutations (there is no limit) so it is important to check the input
                            data is valid. The data is sent to a validation function in the performing module and will
                            notify the user of invalid entries
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Verify Interfaces:</strong> Checks that all the hardware needed for performing the
                            task is available and will notify the user of unavailable hardware
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 id="main-performing-loop">Main Performing Loop</h3>
                    <p>The performing function will require a set of parameters for performing the task and these
                        parameters will be set in a definition record. The creator of the definitions can also group
                        definitions by certain criteria which can be placed into a definition batch file</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Definition Batch:</strong> Current definition batch from the list of batches to be
                            performed
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Definition Record:</strong> Current record from the list in the current batch</li>
                        <li><strong>Perform Function:</strong> Specific module that will be performing the task and
                            return the results
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 id="session-wrap-up">Session Wrap Up</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Safe State Shutdown:</strong> To prevent any data loss and to make sure the device
                            under test can be removed
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Session Analysis:</strong> Will display a report of the session</li>
                        <li><strong>Release Data:</strong> The user can choose to release the data for review by other
                            members of the team
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
                    <p>Typically, test applications develop from basic essential functions growing over time to cover
                        variants and multiple tasks along with further aspects for certification and reliability
                        criteria. The applications are very useful; however without the use of a common structure the
                        system will take up nearly all your time, and can be a source of frustration to continuous
                        modify, maintain and document.</p>
                    <p>The ideal solution to organising the test applications is a test management platform. Current
                        applications are either costly and require a licence for each system, and comparable open source
                        software is tailored for web or program testing.</p>
                    <p>This is where the test automation framework comes into play. We can offer a test management
                        platform that is simple to use and easy to develop with.</p>
                    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
                    <h3 id="session-queue">Session Queue</h3>
                    <p>When the user starts the application they are presented with a queue window.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="https://github.com/gre-elec/gre-elec.github.io/blob/main/img/test_queue_viewer.PNG?raw=true"
                             alt="test_queue_viewer"/></p>
                    <p>This application is able to queue multiple sessions and shows the user the details of the
                        selected tests they wish to run.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="https://github.com/gre-elec/gre-elec.github.io/blob/main/img/test_queue.PNG?raw=true"
                             alt="test_queue_viewer"/></p>
                    <p>Having a queue rather than a single selection allows the user to run the same test multiple times
                        or build a series of smaller test sessions. The choice will be down to preference of how long
                        the tests might take or how the users would like the tests reported.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>setup files</strong> have been created by the test developer; the user selects a file
                        and the details will be displayed. The user can modify the details and save it as a new setup
                        file.</p>
                    <h3 id="session-monitor">Session Monitor</h3>
                    <p>Understanding where the session is at a glance is vitally important when it comes to more complex
                        test
                        systems. When failures are found, being able to quickly discover where the issue is occurring
                        can
                        save huge amounts of time in solving the issue.</p>
                    <p>When the session is running the user will be able to view the progress and control the session
                        with the monitor.</p>
                    <p>
